Lua Worker
==========

Package for running a Lua VM in a Web Worker.


Emscripten
----------

To build the required JavaScript, you need to have [Emscripten][] in
your PATH. To build, simply run `./build`.

The work in `emlua.patch` is borrowed from kripken's [lua.vm.js][].

**Note:** This does not include the Lua â†’ JS bridge, since allowing
access to JavaScript from Lua might not always be desirable.
